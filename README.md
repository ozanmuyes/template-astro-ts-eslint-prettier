## Using the Template

> [!NOTE]
> Although provisional package manager is `pnpm` you can use any other package manager as you wish. In that case please be sure that the correct versions of dependencies were installed.

* Navigate to the [template repo](https://github.com/ozanmuyes/template-astro-ts-eslint-prettier)
* Clicking "Use this template" to create a new repository (on your GitHub account)
* Clone the new repository to your development machine
* Navigate to the local cloned directory
* Run `pnpm i`

If you use VSCode / VSCodium as your IDE then it is highly adviced to install recommended extensions. Please refer to the [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_recommended-extensions).
